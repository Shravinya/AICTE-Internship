# AI Chatbot Using NLP & Machine Learning

This chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to respond to user queries.
## WEEK 1
## Features
- Uses `NLTK` for text processing.
- Implements `TF-IDF` for feature extraction.
- Trains a `Logistic Regression` model to classify user inputs.
- Prints `TF-IDF` vectors for analysis.
- Provides responses based on predefined intents.

## Improvements
- Added TF-IDF feature extraction to convert text into numerical form.
- Displayed TF-IDF vectors for better understanding of feature weights.
- Trained Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF features.


## WEEK 2
## Improvements
- Expanded intent matching with better response classification.
- Improved training data to enhance chatbot accuracy.
- Randomized responses for more natural conversations.
- Better handling of unknown queries to avoid incorrect replies.
- Refined intent labels to ensure accurate classification.
